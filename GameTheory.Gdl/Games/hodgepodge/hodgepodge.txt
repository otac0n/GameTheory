The overall game consists of nine copies of Buttons and Lights.  In each copy of Buttons and Lights, there are three lights and three buttons.   Pushing the first button in each group toggles the first light; pushing the second button in each group interchanges the first and second lights; and pushing the third button in each group moves the value of the second light into the third.  Initially, the lights are all off.  The goal is to turn on all of the lights in the fifth group.  The settings of the other lights are irrelevant.
