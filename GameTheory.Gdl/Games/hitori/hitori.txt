The player is presented with a game board filled with numbers, and the goal is to remove all duplicates from rows and columns. There are a couple rules to how this must be accomplished- first, no removed squares can be adjacent to other removed squares (diagonally adjacent is ok). The second rule is that every non-removed square must be reachable from every other non-removed square, so that the entirety of the non-removed squares is one contiguous figure. To simplify things, we decided to remove this second constraint, which now presents multiple solutions instead of just one to the player. The game is initialized with a set of digits in the grid, legal moves include removing a digit from the board provided it is not adjacent to any other previously removed digits. The game ends when all the rows and columns have had all their duplicates removed.
