Chinook consists of two games of a variant of checkers played on a single checkers board, with one game on the odd squares and another played on the even squares.  The board in this version is a torus, i.e. it wraps around both horizontally and vertically.  There are no kings, and captures are not required.  The game terminates after 40 moves or whenever either player loses all of its pieces on one of the two boards.  The white player's score is its score the odd board, and the black player's score is its score on the even board.
