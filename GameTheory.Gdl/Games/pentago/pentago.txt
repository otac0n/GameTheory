Pentago is played on a 6x6 board divided into four 3x3 sub-boards (or quadrants). Taking turns, the two players place a mark of their color (either red or black) onto an unoccupied space on the board and then rotate one of the sub-boards by 90 degrees either clockwise or counterclockwise. A player wins by getting five of their marks in a  horizontal,vertical, or diagonal row (either before or after the sub-board rotation in their move).  If all 36 spaces on the board are occupied without a row of five being formed, then the game is a draw.
