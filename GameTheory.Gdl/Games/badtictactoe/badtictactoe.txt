Tic Tac Toe (or Noughts and Crosses, Xs and Os) is a game for two players who take turns placing their marks in a 3x3 grid.  The first player to place three of his marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.  Differs from Tic TacToe in that the game description has unnecessary subgoals and unnecessary rules.
