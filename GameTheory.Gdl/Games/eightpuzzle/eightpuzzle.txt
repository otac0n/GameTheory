The 8-puzzle is a simple sliding tile puzzle. The game board is a 3x3 square with numbered tiles in all but one of the cells.

The state of the game is modified by sliding numbered tiles into the empty space from adjacent cells, thus moving the empty space to a new location. There are four possible moves - moving the empty space up, down, left, or right. Obviously, not all moves are possible in all states.

The ultimate object of the game is to place the tiles in order and position the empty square in the lower right cell.  The game terminates after 60 moves. The goal state is worth 100 points; all other states are worth 0 points.
