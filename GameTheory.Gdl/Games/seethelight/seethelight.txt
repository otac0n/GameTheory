See the light is a single player game.   There are ten lights and ten actions, and there is a sequential order on the light.  All of the lights are off in the initial state, and the goal is to make them all on.  If none of the lights are on, doing action h turns on the first light.  If any of the lights are on, doing action h turns on the light after the highest ranking light that is on.  Doing any other action does nothing.  Once on, a light stays on forever.  There is a step counter that terminates the game after ten actions have been performed.  The game is designed so that there is exactly one sequence of actions that achieves a goal of 100 - viz. ten occurrences of the h action.  Luckily, non-terminal states along the way also have goal of 100, so players that "see the light" can find their way in this combinatoric maze.
