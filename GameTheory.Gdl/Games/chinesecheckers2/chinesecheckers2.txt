Chinese Checkers 2 is a 2 player game.  On each turn one of the players moves a piece forward or jumps over pieces if obstructed and the next hole is clear.  If no moves possible, then the player must pass.  The objective of the game is to get all three marble from the home three squares to the opposite three squares.  Rewards are 0 points if the player has no marbles in place, 25 points for one marble, 50 points for two marbles, and 100 points for three marbles.  The game terminates on the 40th step or at the end of a turn on which one player gets all marbles home.
