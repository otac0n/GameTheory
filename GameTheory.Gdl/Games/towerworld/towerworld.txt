A 2 player board game, where both players have a knight figure with which they have to jump from tower to tower in order to reach their opponent's start line.

At the same time, both players have to try and prevent each other from doing the above. If you are the first player to place a tower on your opponent's start line and occupy it with your knight, you win the game.


The game was invented by Thomas Brunner.
