Hex For Three is a three player version of Hex.  Each of the three players tries to form a path from one of the player's home cells on one side of the board to the a home cell on the other side of the board.  Home cells for each player are distinguished by color, and each corner cell is a home cell for the players whose home cells are adjacent to that corner.  The central cell is out of play for any of the players.  The game ends when one of the players has a winning line or when the board is entirely full, whichever comes first.
