There are two caterpillars on a grid of leaves, initially at opposite corners. Each time they move, they eat the leaf behind them and move to a horizontally or vertically adjacent non-empty square.  If a player still has a move and its opponent has no moves (i.e. it is surrounded by empty space), then the first player gets 100 points and the second player gets 0 points.  Otherwise, both players get 0 points.
