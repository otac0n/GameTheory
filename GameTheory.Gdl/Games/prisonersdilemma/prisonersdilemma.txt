You are situated in a room with another person and a piece of candy. Each of you are given two options: eat the candy or pass. If both of you choose to eat the candy, you must share it, begrudgingly. If only one chooses to eat the candy, that person gets to enjoy it all to himself, while the other must watch in agony. If both choose to pass, they resume their day feeling fairly content. The game is played for 8 rounds - the first round is a practice round worth 0 points, and your score is the total of the rewards for the next 7 rounds.
